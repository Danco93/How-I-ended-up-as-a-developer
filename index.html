        <h3>Early Days</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>
          I went to college in 2011 fulltime while also working fulltime to be
          able to afford school. At the time I was pursuing a bachelors in
          bioimedical engineering. I eventually switched to math education, and
          then one final time dropping the education concentration and focusing
          more on theotretical mathematics and finishing with a B.A. in
          mathematics.
        </p>
        <p>
          My plan at the time was to finish school and try and land a role as a
          data analyst or jr. data scientist, but as they say "the best liad
          plans of mice and men often go awry." I graduated in 2016 and was
          unable to find a job in data analytics but what I did find was a role
          in managment for Amazon.com"

      <div class="story" id="opsLife">
        <h3>E-Commerce and Operations</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Over the next 5 years I worked my way up from a manager in operations
          at amazon to other manager and operations based roles for RGBSI and
          Chewy.com. I learned a lot about managing people and processes, but I
          was still not satisfied.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted to be able to use my degree and work with data. I started
          looking for jobs in data analytics and data science, but I was still
          not able to find anything. My thoughts then started to become more
          along the lines of pursuing a small business in a field I had always
          been pasionate about - media. The way I saw it was, it was better to
          fail now taking a chance than later on in life when I had kids and
          maybe this could fill me with the sense of purpose I had been looking
          for.

        <h3>Small-Business and Self Discovery</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>
          So, I started a small media company and began to learn about
          photography, videography, and editing. I started to learn about
          marketing and how to build a brand. I started to learn about
          entrepreneurship and how to build a business. I started to learn about
          myself and what I wanted to do with my life. I had a lot of knowledge
          on photography already but learned a ton about videography and met so
          many cool people.
        </p>
        <p>
          I toured across the country with all sorts of bands and did a quite a
          few weddings - you can see some of my pictures in my
          <a href="hobbies.html">hobbies page</a>, and I'm thankful for that
          time but unfortunatley it just wasn't financially lucrative enough to
          do it full time after a couple years. Ultimately, I had to make a
          decision to either go back to working in operations or find a new
          career path. I was still not satisfied of the idea of going back to
          working in operations and I was still not able to find a job in data
          analytics or data science. I started to look into other options and
          started to think about coding, web development, and software
          engineering. I started to learn about coding and web development and
          started to learn about software engineering. Around this time I met a
          photographer - who was also a devleoper - in the industry who told me
          he thought I really could land a role in the field if I really
          commited and taught myself. So, that night, I made the commitment.

        <h3>Failure and The Climb</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>
          After I promised myself I would learn to code, I started to learn
          about coding and web development. I started to learn about software
          engineering. I took a job as a team lead with a medical manufacturing
          company to make enough money to pay my bills but leave me enough free
          time after work to study coding and web development. I started to
          learn about html, css, and javascript. I started to learn about react,
          node.js, and express. I started to learn about databases and how to
          build a full stack application. I started to learn about how to build
          a website and how to build a web application. I learned about the
          freedom a career in software development could give me and how I could
          work from anywhere in the world. I started to learn about myself and
          what I wanted to do with my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Doing all of this at a fairly slow pace for the first year as a team
          lead around 11 months in, I decided to make a daily commitment to code
          at least 2 hours per day every day and be a web developer by 2027. The
          team lead role was great, but I knew from day one, it felt like a way
          to exist for me, and not a way to live. Coding, web development, and
          software engineering was a way to live. Seeing the engagment it gave
          to me mentally was so encouraging, and the possibiltiy of implenting
          it for my hobbies and other passions, culminated in this epiphany of
          "I wish I would have tried this 10 years ago."

        <h3>The Path Ahead</h3>
        <hr />
        <p>
          I'm still a team lead, for a medical manufacturing company, but I am
          also a self-taught web developer and activley seeking employment in
          the field. I am currently working on a few projects to build my
          portfolio and gain experience. You can see those
          <a href="resume.html">here</a>, but am hoping to land a role in the
          field by 2027. I am also looking to work on some open-source projects
          and contribute to the community. I am also looking to learn more about
          coding and web development and software engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
          feel like it took me a long time to find my way, but I am finally on
          the right path. I am excited about the future and what it holds. If
          you've made it this far in reading about my story, I hope you see
          someone who's got a lot of experience across many fields and is not
          just a "coder" but a leader, an self-starter and someone who is
          passionate about what they do. I hope you see someone who is not just
          looking for a job, but looking for a career and a way to make a
          difference in the world. I hope you see someone who is not just
          looking for a paycheck, but looking for a way to make a living doing
          what they love. I hope you see someone who is not just looking for a
          job, but looking for a way to make a difference in the world through
          coding.
